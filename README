NAME
    starmachine_init.d - shared LSB init.d script for running PSGI apps with
    Starman

DESCRIPTION
    A management suite for production deployments of one or more PSGI web
    apps under *nix. Runs each app with independent libraries, using
    Starman. Right now, the "suite" is just a flexible init.d script. But
    this might grow into a suite. Or it may not.

    The init script itself depends only on core Perl 5.6, although of course
    Starman and Server::Starter, plus your application's dependencies, must
    of course be available for your app to run. These can be in a
    local::lib-compatible directory, living by default at
    `/path/to/myapp/extlib`.

  Most basic setup - single app
        git clone git://github.com/solgenomics/starmachine.git
        cd starmachine;
        ln -s /path/to/myapp .;
        sudo ln -s $PWD/starmachine_init.d /etc/init.d/myapp;
        sudo /etc/init.d/myapp start

    And now /etc/init.d/myapp is a well-behaved init script that starts your
    app under Starman using /path/to/myapp/script/myapp.psgi with 10
    workers, on port 8080, putting the logs in the starmachine dir.

CONFIGURATION
    Starmachine has very sensible defaults, but almost everything it does is
    configurable in a `starmachine.conf` file. It looks like this:

        # conf for the ambikon front-end proxy
        ambikon_integrationserver[port] = 80
        ambikon_integrationserver[user] = www-data

        # conf for the SGN legacy app
        sgn[port] = 8201
        sgn[user] = sgn_web

        # conf for the Mimosa aligner app
        mimosa[port] = 8202
        mimosa[user] = mimosa
        mimosa[access_log] = /var/log/mimosa.access.log
        mimosa[error_log]  = /var/log/mimosa.error.log

  Available configuration settings
    port
        Port the app will listen on. Default 8080.

    user
        User that the app will run under. Defaults to the user that runs the
        init.d script.

    group
        Group that the app will run under. Defaults to the primary group of
        the user that runs the init.d script.

    workers
        Number of worker processes to use. Default 10.

    timeout
        todo. Default 20.

    preload_app
        Default 1. If 1, preload the application in the parent process
        before forking workers.

    server_starter_args
        Default empty. String interpolated directly into the invocation of
        "start_server" (see start_server).

    starman_args
        Default empty. String interpolated directly into the invocation of
        "starman" (see starman).

    access_log
        Access log file. Default "(starmachine_root)/(app_name).access.log".

    error_log
        Error log file. Default "(starmachine_root)/(app_name).error.log"

    app_dir
        Application main directory. Default
        "(starmachine_root)/(app_name)/".

    psgi_file
        Path (relative to app_dir, or absolute) of PSGI file to use for
        starting the app.

    pid_file
        PID file in which to store the PID of the Server::Starter parent
        process. Default "(starmachine_root)/(app_name).pid".

    status_file
        Server::Starter status file. Default
        "(starmachine_root)/(app_name).status".

    extlib
        Path to bundled dependencies (extlibs) of the app, either relative
        to the app_dir, or absolute. Default: "extlib".
